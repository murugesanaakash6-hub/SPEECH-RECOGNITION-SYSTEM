##The Speech Recognition System is an embedded project designed and simulated using the Wokwi online simulator. Since real voice input is not supported in Wokwi, speech commands are simulated using the Serial Monitor, which represents recognized voice commands. An Arduino UNO acts as the main controller that receives command inputs and performs corresponding actions.
In this system, predefined text commands such as “ON” and “OFF” are entered through the Serial Monitor, simulating voice recognition output from a speech module. The Arduino reads these commands via serial communication, processes them, and controls an output device such as an LED or relay, representing appliances or devices.
This approach demonstrates the working logic of a speech-controlled system without requiring physical speech recognition hardware. It helps in understanding command-based control, serial communication, and device automation. The Wokwi simulator allows easy testing, debugging, and demonstration of the system.
The project is suitable for academic demonstrations, mini projects, and concept learning, showing how speech recognition systems can be integrated with embedded controllers for automation applications.
